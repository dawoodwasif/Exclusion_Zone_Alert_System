# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8 and Streamlit

This repository is a comprehensive open-source project that demonstrates the integration of object detection and tracking using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and Streamlit, a popular Python web application framework for building interactive web applications. This project provides a user-friendly and customizable interface to draw danger zone polygon to generate alerts if it detects and tracks a person inside the zone in real-time video streams. Additionaly, this system provides a detailed statistics report based on the video stream alongside a real time counter on the display.
